# About
A Discord bot for managing your schedules, much like an alarm.
It provides schedules(weekly reminders) and tasks(one-time reminder). You can mark tasks as done and the bot will not remind you about it. However, tasks cannot be kept forever, and are removed once their time is due.

Written in Python 3.10.
Made with disnake(discord api wrapper) and motor (async mongodb driver).
